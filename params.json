For standard package/pin dimensions, cheap PCB's can be created quickly and easily. If large amounts are needed, breakout boards can be panelized in a grid for additional cost effectiveness.\r\n\r\n- Package footprint\r\n- Intended part designed for DRV, special layout considerations?\r\n- Mechanical drawing\r\n- PCB Dimensions\r\n- PCB Cost\r\n- Order\r\n \r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n###16-pin HTSSOP\r\n- Intended device(s): DRV8833CPWPR\r\n- \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
