# breakout-boards
A collection of cheap, simple breakout boards used for prototyping.

Breakout boards are useful during the prototyping design phase, as they allow functional validation of simple surface mount ICs. For standard package/pin dimensions, cheap PCB's can be created quickly and easily. If large amounts are needed, breakout boards can be panelized in a grid for additional cost effectiveness.
