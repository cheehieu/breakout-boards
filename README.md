## Overview
Breakout boards are useful during the prototyping design phase, as they allow functional validation of simple surface mount ICs. For standard package/pin dimensions, cheap PCB's can be created quickly and easily. If large amounts are needed, breakout boards can be panelized in a grid for additional cost effectiveness.

This repository contains breakout boards for the following footprints:
